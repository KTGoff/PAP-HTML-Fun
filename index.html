      Trotsky was born in the East Village to a young mother and a six-toed bodega cat father. One of five kittens, she was shortly adopted by her human, Kate. After gaining power through kibble and nose spots, she lived all over New York before settling in Brooklyn. Her hobbies include hunting, begging for treats, and napping.
